### A Simple Introduction

Hello everyone. First off, I just start off by saying how excited I am to share my thoughts and perspective with you on this page. For those who have decided to honestly review what I have to say, thank you for your time. So, I think the best way to start is to share some of my life experiences. I believe you’ll have a better understanding of where I’m coming from. If not, that’s okay too. My intentions are too help people along the way in the same manner that others have done for me.

So, I was a kid born and raised in one Southern Texas. I spent most of my time as a child playing sports. Now I know what you’re thinking: “Texas? Athletics?” You played football? Nope I was devoted to the game of basketball. I have an old brother who fell in love with the game and I followed in his footsteps. Before long I found myself with a scholarship at the age of 15, going to a preparatory boarding school just to play and attend school. I have a father and mother who have not only supported me in my passions but pushed me to be the best I could be. 

Hooping was everything to me. It’s where I not only found fun and joy but a sense of worth. It’s where I placed my identity. I grew up in a Christian home so I was always aware of God and believed in His existence but that was it. Moving forward, by the time I was 18, I was a senior in school. For those who have spent time in the athletic world, you’ll know that this year is one of the most critical seasons for an athlete who wants to play in college and maybe even go pro. Fortunately, I had options and goals of where I could play but it all came to crash and burn. That year was when I tore a serve muscle in my knee. The following year (as an official college basketball player) I received a concussion that ended my career from that day on.

Now why am I sharing all of this? Because I’m simply thankful for where God has brought me from that point in my life. Ironically, during that same year as a senior, I was introduced into computer programming: my second love. My history teacher (Mrs. Lord) exposed me to such a work and there was no turning back. I decided to major in Computer Science that following year (which was not a cake walk). I received my first job as a Developer after my first year at Azusa Pacific University and a new part of myself has been satisfied. 

At this point, I want to wrap up this introduction by talking about my faith. I’m doing so because it’s the growing foundation of my life. It has sprung forth everything in my life that’s truly considered to be “good.” My foundation is this: I believe in one God who sent His son, [Jesus Christ] to die for my sins so that I might be renewed in His image as I come to know Him during this life and in the next (John 17:3, Genesis 1:27). Apart from Him all that I’ve shared means absolutely nothing and life becomes meaningless. I’ve decided to create this page for such notions. Software and technology have become a huge part of my life so integrating my faith in Jesus in this realm is nothing but the necessity. I hope that my experiences in this truth will help others along the way in things they might be experiencing. It’s safe to say that I’ve been on an adventurous journey. But it’s far from done. To my audience here I will say this: I’m excited to bring you on this journey with me so let’s travel together... #Neverland.
